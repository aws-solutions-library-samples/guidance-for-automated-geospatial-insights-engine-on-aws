# **AGIE** (Automated Geospatial Insight Engine)

## Guidance Overview

Many industries depend upon intelligence and insights gained from earth observation data (satellite imagery, aerial imagery, remote sensing) and processed geospatial data, within their enterprise. Earth observation data, coupled with models (mechanistic and AI-powered), helps customers to improve demand and supply forecasting, automate risk management and mitigation workflows, improve customer outcomes, and improve their ability to meet regulatory requirements.

### Success
Upon successful deployment of this guidance, you will be able to do the following:
- Enroll polygons (areas of interest, farm fields, geographical areas of land) for processing and analysis
- Schedule the frequency of polygon analysis, for each polygon, to support one-time and recurring automated processing
- Automate the searching, downloading, clipping, and processing of earth observation data into NDVI maps and meta data, per polygon
- Customize, extend, and build upon existing earth observation index calculations to meet your specific use case requirements
- Search and access processed imagery and meta data via an API with user Authentication and Authorization
- Directly search and query processed imagery and meta data via the integrated AWS Services
- Establish customized alerts via Amazon SNS based upon meta data processed for each polygon
- Visualize processed imagery and meta data via an optional but integrated UI
- Integrate, customize, extend and augment existing workflows to achieve business goals

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWS_REGION                       | AGIE's AWS Region deployment.                                                                                         |
| ENVIRONMENT                      | Environment (.e.g dev, stage or prod). You can have multiple environment deployed in the same AWS account and region. |

```shell
export ENVIRONMENT=<ENVIRONMENT>
export AWS_REGION=<AWS_REGION>
```

The installer will guide you through a list of configurable settings that you can apply to your environment deployment. Run the following command to start the installation of AGIE:

```shell
cd $CLI_FOLDER
bin/run.js install -e $ENVIRONMENT -r $AWS_REGION
```

### 4. Deployment Validation

To validate the deployment, open the CloudFormation console and verify the status of the following stacks

1. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-shared
2. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-regions
3. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-stacServer
4. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-regionsExtension
5. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-notifications
6. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-results
7. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-ui
8. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-engine
9. agie-\<ENVIRONMENT\>-scheduler

### 5. Set your initial password

Run the following command to set the password for the administrator user (replace the `ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL` and `<PASSWORD>` with your own) :

```shell
export USER_POOL_ID=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/agie/$ENVIRONMENT/shared/cognitoUserPoolId" --query "Parameter.Value" --output text)

aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID  --username <ADMINISTRASTOR_EMAIL> --password <PASSWORD> --permanent
```

Now that you have everything set up, visit [walkthrough](docs/walkthrough.md) to get started on working with `AGIE`.

## Next Steps

- Instead of relying on the container provided by AGIE, you can integrate your own custom image processing implementation into the application. This approach allows you to have greater control over the image processing functionality and tailor it to your specific requirements.
- To achieve optimal performance for the engine processor, it is recommended to fine-tune the Elastic Container Service (ECS) task size. By adjusting the task size, you can allocate the appropriate amount of compute resources (CPU and memory) to the engine processor, ensuring efficient utilization while avoiding over-provisioning or under-provisioning.
- The AGIE engine processor generates analysis results that are stored in the STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) server and Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). By utilizing these processed results, you can unlock new opportunities to address your business needs and drive innovation within your organization.

## Cleanup

When deleting resources, please follow these steps:

```shell
cd $CLI_FOLDER
bin/run.js remove -e $ENVIRONMENT -r $AWS_REGION
```

Also, we've configured some resources not to be deleted automatically. Please follow these steps to delete them manually:

1. **Open the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (<https://console.aws.amazon.com>) and sign in with your AWS credentials.

2. **Navigate to the S3 Service**: In the AWS Management Console, search for the "S3" service or select it from the list of services.

3. **List All S3 Buckets**: On the S3 dashboard, you'll see a list of all the S3 buckets in your AWS account. Locate all the buckets with `agie-<environment>` as the prefix.

   **Note**: S3 bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts, so the bucket name may not directly indicate its purpose or association with your CDK deployment. You may need to cross-reference the bucket name with the resources listed in your CDK application or CloudFormation stack.

4. **Empty the S3 Bucket**: Before you can delete an S3 bucket, you must first remove all objects (files and folders) inside the bucket. Select the bucket you want to empty, then click the "Empty" button.

   **Warning**: Emptying an S3 bucket permanently deletes all objects inside it. Double-check that you have selected the correct bucket before proceeding.

5. **Confirm the Bucket Empty Action**: A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to enter the bucket name to confirm the action. Type the bucket name exactly as shown and click the "Empty" button to proceed.

6. **Wait for the Bucket to Empty**: The process of emptying an S3 bucket may take some time, depending on the number and size of objects in the bucket. Wait until the bucket is completely empty before proceeding to the next step.

7. **Delete the S3 Bucket**: Once the bucket is empty, right-click on the bucket name and select "Delete" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can select the bucket and click the "Delete" button at the top of the bucket list.

8. **Confirm the Bucket Deletion**: A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to type the bucket name to confirm the deletion. Type the bucket name exactly as shown and click the "Delete bucket" button to proceed.

9. **Repeat for Other Buckets**: If you have multiple S3 buckets created by your CDK deployment that you want to delete, repeat steps 4-8 for each bucket.
